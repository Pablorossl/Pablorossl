### Areas of Expertise
My expertise spans across multiple domains of modern web development. In **Frontend Development**, I specialize in creating responsive designs with thoughtful component architecture and modern UI/UX principles. I bring designs to life through **UI/UX Design** work, where I use Figma for prototyping and follow user-centered design methodologies to ensure exceptional user experiences.

I'm proficient in **Version Control** practices, managing Git workflows, facilitating collaborative development, conducting thorough code reviews, and maintaining clean branch management. My experience with **Operating Systems**, particularly Linux administration, shell scripting, and terminal operations, allows me to work efficiently in diverse development environments.

Security is paramount in my work. I implement **Security Practices** including secure coding standards, robust authentication systems, data protection measures, and proactive vulnerability prevention. My **Problem Solving** approach combines algorithm design, code optimization, systematic debugging, and performance tuning to deliver efficient solutions. I'm committed to maintaining **Web Standards**, ensuring accessibility compliance, writing semantic HTML, and following SEO best practices in all my projects.

## Languages

I'm a native **Spanish** speaker with professional proficiency in both **English** and **French**, which enables me to collaborate effectively with international teams and communicate seamlessly across diverse cultural contexts.

## Current Learning & Growth

I'm constantly evolving as a developer and currently deepening my knowledge across several key areas. I'm mastering the **React Ecosystem**, working extensively with Hooks, Context API, Redux, and various state management solutions to build more efficient applications. My passion for **Cybersecurity** drives me to study web security principles including the OWASP Top 10, encryption techniques, and secure authentication implementations.

I'm expanding into **Backend Development**, gaining proficiency with Node.js and Express to build RESTful APIs and design robust database architectures. In the realm of **DevOps & Deployment**, I'm learning Docker containerization, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and deploying applications on cloud platforms like AWS and Vercel. Quality assurance is crucial, so I'm developing skills in **Testing** using Jest, React Testing Library, and end-to-end testing with Cypress.

Finally, I'm focused on **Performance** optimization, studying Web Vitals metrics, applying optimization techniques, and ensuring my applications meet the highest accessibility standards to provide exceptional experiences for all users.
